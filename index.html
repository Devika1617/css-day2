        To make cake designs with icing, first make buttercream frosting, which is good for decorating. Split the frosting into batches and add food coloring to get the colors you want to decorate with. Then, put a thick layer of frosting on your cake as a base, making it as smooth as possible.
                So be ok with making existing designs as long as you credit the original designer. It's also ok to just make one small change or tweak to the cake to put your personal spin on it. Again, if you've used someone else's work as inspiration don't hesitate to credit them.
        
        When storing a cake overnight, you need to cover your cake fully to prevent any air and store it at the right temperature. To do this, you can easily wrap your cake in foil or plastic wrap, and place it in an airtight container. Make sure to keep your cake in the refrigerator overnight.
     You've guessed it right! Chocoholics' favorite dense and moist chocolate cake ranks top of the list. Glazing the cake with a thick chocolate ganache is one of the most popular ways to enjoy this dessert!
      Chocolate is often touted to be one of the best cake flavours. It's almost impossible to resist a slice of gooey, moist chocolate cake. These cakes are made with chocolate sponge, layered with chocolate ganache or mousse, or topped with truffle frosting.
